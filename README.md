# Hangman board

This is a Hangman gameboard, drawn entirely in CSS.

Toggle the visibility of body parts by ID:

`#head`
`#torso`
`#left-arm`
`#right-arm`
`#left-leg`
`#right-leg`

Adjust the gameboard size and placement in CSS > `#board`

* Board must be square (e.g. 300px by 300px) for the body parts to align correctly
